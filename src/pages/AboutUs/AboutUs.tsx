          We're a team of three developers. We all had the same mentor, and to
          our surprise, we're not only from the same country but also from the
          same city. Realizing this unique coincidence, we teamed up early in
          the Code JS interview stages. We supported each other in preparation,
          conducted trial interviews, and shared insights.

        <div className={'collaboration'}>
          As we progressed to the final project, we became a tight-knit team,
          knowing each other's strengths and weaknesses. This friendship enabled
          seamless collaboration, fostering an environment where each of us felt
          comfortable and equally important.
